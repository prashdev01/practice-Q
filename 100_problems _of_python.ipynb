    "python is a high level programing languege that is used for almost all the purpose . it is created by guido van rasam in 1991 it is used to wide range of applications like machine learnig and artificial intalegince there some other uess as well like web development or creating desktop applications , python is one of the most famous programing languege in nowdays that's it a huge community . behind this popularity of the python languauge there are some key features , like simple syntax and its very readable unlike other programimng languase python can be readable for any one who has some basic knowladge of the english and programing . beacuse of its simplisity it widely used by beginers as well as professsionals it has huge  no. of library support for python is a dynamicaly typed programing languege  that means you dont have to specify the data types it automaticaly detects the data type's by its syntax , python supports oops concepts which opens a lot more apportunities to do some next level stuffs  "
