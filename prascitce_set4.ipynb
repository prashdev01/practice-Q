Create an instance of this class and use it to test out the\\nimplemented methods for deposit, withdrawal, and interest calculation.\\nQ4. Write a Python class called \"Animal\" with attributes for \"name\" and \"species\". Create a subclass of\\n\"Animal\" called \"Dog\" with additional attributes for \"breed\" and \"owner\". Implement both classes with\\nappropriate methods and constructors to initialise their properties. Create instances of both classes and\\nuse them to print out the various properties of the animals and dogs, such as their names, species,\\nbreeds, and owners.\\nQ5. Create a class called \"Car\" with properties for \"make\", \"model\", and \"year\". Create a subclass of \"Car\"\\ncalled \"ElectricCar\" with additional properties for \"battery_size\" and \"range\". Create objects of both\\nclasses and print out their properties.\\nQ6.
